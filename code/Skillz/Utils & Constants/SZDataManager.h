/**
 The SZDataManager takes care of the local data cache. It is responsible for caching data that should be available in offline mode (such as own offers and requests, open deals and messages. Besides caching data that was created on the device, the SZDataManager communicates with the application's back end to check for new messages or accepted deal proposals, download the new data and cache it on the device as well.
 The SZDataManager is designed as a singleton. Its shared instance can be accessed by calling `[SZDataManager sharedInstance]`. However, most of it's methods are static, so the actual instance of the SZDataManager is usually only needed to store and access properties, with the exception of the the <saveCurrentEntry:completionBlock> method, which is an instance method.
