coaching guide to provide Internet users with information on the
fast Internet broadband access available today and the different
types of broadband service you can select.<br>
<br>
 <b>WHAT IS BROADBAND?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">BROADBAND is the common term
for a very fast connection to the internet. It allows users to
download online entertainment such as video clips and music,
listen to digital radio, send e-mail faster and speeds up
everything they do online.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A broadband service can
transmit information at up to 40 times the speed of a dial-up
modem connection. As the connection is always on, like water or
electricity, users don't need to dial up every time they want to
log on.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Broadband ADSL also lets people
surf the internet and use the telephone at the same
time.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Broadband is revolutionising
online activities everywhere for businesses, entertainment and
public services. Faster speeds of up to 160 times a dial-up
connection will bring about new services, including internet-TV
and video on demand, across home, business and public life.<br>

<br>
</font> <font face="Verdana"><b>Fast Internet</b></font><font
size="-1" face="Verdana">:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For the majority of those
looking to upgrade to broadband Internet for the business or
home, it's all about the extra speed.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Generally, the term broadband
refers to a high-speed Internet transmission (usually 256Kbps and
above) featuring a permanent connection. Now coming in a range of
high-speed connection plans across a variety of access services,
broadband promises to knock the socks off its analog dial-up
predecessor for downloading multimedia content images and
graphics, videos, networking games, and music
streaming.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are three ways of getting
online with broadband - via your TV cable box, your satellite or
via your phone line. If you've got cable TV, this is an easy
option, but the most common type of broadband access is an
upgraded home telephone line called ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital
Subscriber Line). ADSL is always connected so needn't be dialled
up each time, and you can make phone calls on the same line while
it's being used. This entails two costs - a special broadband
modem, and an upgrade for your phone line. It's easy to avoid
paying for these, however - broadband telephone companies are
desperate to sign up customers, so all-inclusive bundles where
the start-up costs are paid are common.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Always on
connection</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">More than just the practical
benefits of a faster connection, broadband can also change the
way you approach using the Internet. With a dial-up connection
you may consider it a nuisance to log on frequently to look up
small items online &#8212; for example, using the Yellow Pages to
find a phone number. If, instead, you have an always-on, fast
connection, these tasks can be completed quickly, with little
fuss. This may seem a trivial example, but it demonstrates a
change to a more casual approach to Internet usage.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Price Factor</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Given that broadband services
are often touted as being more expensive &#8212; there's also the
issue of price. In short, broadband is more costly than
dial-up.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, with so many packages
out there today many broadband packages are quite comparable to
dial-up services. If you are a frequent dial-up user, this
equates to many phone calls during a month. Once you factor in
the cost of local calls every time you dial-up, plus the cost of
your monthly plan, your 56Kbps account may not seem that cheap
after all. If you've opted for a dedicated second phone line, you
will also be paying additional line rental fees. Compare this to
the $50-70 ADSL plans now available and you can start to see the
economic potential of broadband services to their dial-up
counterparts.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With an ADSL or cable modem
connection, for example, you can surf the Web without tying up
your phone line &#8212; plus, the connection can potentially be
shared amongst other PCs in your home. ADSL, cable modem,
satellite and wireless services do generally cost more to set up,
but as you will see from this buying guide, there are a variety
of ways to reduce the costs of installing the service as
well.<br>
<br>
 <b>Types of broadband</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">One of the first decisions to
be made is what kind of connection you want. There are several
options for setting up high-speed services, which all come under
the broadband umbrella. However, the type of broadband service
you need and have access to will be determined by your speed
requirements, budget, and the location (city or regional) of your
home or office.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>ISDN</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Prior to the advent of DSL
there were not many high-speed solutions for the home or office.
One such is ISDN (Integrated services digital network) which is a
dial-up symmetrical service which allows speeds from 64Kbps to
128Kbps. Dedicated ISDN lines can reach up to 256Kbps. The
problem with ISDN is that it is incredibly expensive, especially
in light of current broadband pricing available today. Nor is it
as quick as cable or DSL.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>DSL</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Telephone networks were never
intended to carry data at high speeds; they were initially built
to carry an analog voice by converting your voice into an
electrical signal. A modem converts digital signals into an
analog audio signal that can easily be carried over a phone line.
The technical limitations of phone lines mean that the fastest
they can carry a signal is around 56Kbps.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">DSL (digital subscriber line)
technology gets around this problem by using the phone line to
carry digital signals directly, without converting them to an
analog signal first. This has three advantages: it allows much
higher data rates than a regular modem; the connection is always
on, which means that you don't need to dial-up each time you want
to use the Internet (and incur another cost); and, because the
copper wire is split at the exchange, you can use your home phone
while on the Internet. ADSL leaves the frequency spectrum between
0kHz and 4kHz free for your telephone service and uses 20kHz to
2.2MHz for data transfer over the copper line. In other words,
one phone line will suffice.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are many different types
of DSL, but the one most readily available to consumers and small
 businesses is Asymmetric Digital Subscriber 
Line, or ADSL. The asymmetric term means that the service has a
much higher downstream bandwidth speed than upstream bandwidth
(downstream refers to a transmission from the network to the
user, and "upstream" is in the other direction).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>ADSL modem</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">ADSL is added to an existing
analog phone line in the same way services such as call waiting
are added to existing phone services, in conjunction with a
special modem. The modem plugs into your computer through either
the Ethernet or USB connection (depending on the type of modem),
and in the case of connecting through the Ethernet, a network
card will be required.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For an ADSL connection to work,
your phone needs to be connected directly to the phone exchange
by a copper wire connection, and you need to live within a 5km
radius to the exchange. The distance isn't a problem for most
city residents, but is a great deal more of a problem for rural
residents. Plus, if any part of the connection is digital, for
example through a switchboard, ADSL won't work. For people in
businesses with PABXes, remember that most fax lines are not
connected through the switch, and may not be suitable for
ADSL.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Telephone companies need to install
special equipment at the telephone exchange to handle ADSL
connections. You don't need to know much about
these things except they have weird names like BRAS or DSLAM (DSL
access multiplexor) which essentially convert the copper signal
to the main ATM telecoms fibre backbone.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The best way to find out if
you're eligible for ADSL is to check with the service provider.
Several ISPs now offer services on their Web sites which can tell
you if the copper wires around your area are suitable for DSL
services. According to surveys, around 70 per cent of copper
wires throughout the world are DSL capable.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">ADSL is usually available to
consumers in the following range of speeds:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">* 256Kbps downstream/64Kbps
upstream</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">* 512 Kbps downstream/128Kbps
upstream</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">* 1500Kbps downstream/256Kbps
upstream</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While ADSL can reach speeds of
up to eight to 10Mbps over short copper lengths, it is almost
never run at this speed. Most carriers cap the service at a rate
of 1.5Mbps. This is because only a few customers in a close
proximity to the exchange will be able to get these higher data
rates. So, to avoid favouring users who are geographically close
to the exchange, carriers elect to offer the same speed to all
users.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Other DSL services available 
which are targeted at the SME and larger business
market include SDSL (symmetrical DSL, which basically provides
users with equal upstream and downstream speeds of up to
2.3Mbps), and HDSL or High bit-rate DSL. HDSL, one of the
earliest forms of broadband, is predominantly a business grade
service used for wideband digital transmission within a corporate
site and between the telephone company and a customer. Like SDSL,
HDSL is a symmetrical service and offers speeds of up to 1.5Mbps.
Both symmetrical services are targeted at businesses that require
a higher level of upstream speed, to perform applications such as
Web hosting and teleconferencing (more on these
later).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another developing broadband
technology is Very High data rate DSL, or VDSL. VDSL promises to
offer speeds of up to 50Mbps for lines up to 300 metres in length
and runs on existing single copper pairs. There are two competing
standards of VDSL: one which uses the same technology as ADSL and
essentially adds extra frequencies to the standard ADSL
frequencies; and a second which employs a completely different
coding scheme.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, VDSL is a very
expensive technology to deliver and is unlikely to be deployed on
a wide scale because most customers won't be close enough to the
exchange.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While VDSL has a
much higher possible throughput than ADSL, it doesn't really help
in extending reach over ADSL. Where it is likely to be used is in
an environment where customers are close to the termination point
and a service such as video requiring more than 7Mpbs is being
delivered.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Cable</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The fibre networks that bring
you cable TV at home can be more than an addition to your viewing
options &#8212; it can also be your means to fast Internet
access.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">HFC (hybrid fibre-coaxial)
networks that are used to carry cable TV pictures are also
capable of carrying data at very high rates. The current cable TV
signal doesn't take up all of the available bandwidth, because
these cable networks were designed to carry a digital TV signal,
rather than the current analog signal &#8212; and this spare
bandwidth can also be used to carry Internet data.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, people who live in
blocks of flats or apartments may face additional difficulties. If
cable isn't already installed in your building, getting it
installed requires the cooperation of the body corporate or
building manager.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Even in buildings where cable
is already installed, depending on the type of equipment in place
in your building, you may not be able to use cable as an Internet
connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unlike DSL a cable service is
"shared". This means all subscribers on a given neighbourhood or
node [a connection point] share a fixed amount of bandwidth. In
theory the more people connected to a node, the slower it takes
to download information off the Internet. In other words, a node
accessed by only 250 people will generally provide a faster
service than a node with 2,000 users.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cable companies have tricks to
get around this. One of the cable operators tricks is to scale its
network (where more connection points are added) to
suit the number of customers in a particular area of the network.
Adding more connection points means they are able to rebalance
the network so that customers in all areas of the network are
receiving equal performance levels. Scaling the network is also
known as "Node Grooming" and the cable companies say they carry
 out node grooms regularly.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once the cable is installed,
you'll need a cable modem to get connected. This connects at one
end to the cable, and at the other end to your PC, either through
an Ethernet or a USB connection. Cable modems can transfer data
at theoretical speeds of up to 3Mbps. However, because cable is a
shared medium with many other users on the same line, performance
varies with the amount of subscribers using that particular
stretch of bandwidth, as well as the usage patterns.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most cable modems use Ethernet
connections, and the cable company will be happy to sell you a
network card as part of the installation if you don't already
have one. (In fact, they prefer you to use the card they sell
you, because they know it works well with the modem, even though
&#8212; in theory &#8212; the modem should work with any card.)
When the cable connection is installed, the technician will also
load the required software on your PC. Software is available for
all versions of Windows and for Mac OS, but not all providers
have Mac software, so it's worth checking before you order. While
there is no official support, it is theoretically possible to
connect under Linux.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most cable modems use Ethernet

Linux.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Many operators use a cable modem
that is compliant with the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service
Interface Specification) standard, which is the most common
standard used worldwide. DOCSIS is an open standard, and any
 manufacturer can make modems that support it.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cable download speeds are very
fast, but, as usual, this can depend a great deal on the source
from which the files are being downloaded. Ping times are also
very fast, which is a boon for online games. However, as with the
rest of the Internet, performance varies depending on the time of
day and several other factors, such as the number of subscribers
on the specific bandwidth strand.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Verdana"><b>Satellite</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Satellite is often touted as an
alternative to fixed-line access such as cable or ADSL, but it
does have limitations and is yet to offer the same
sort of data speeds. Despite that, satellite has succeeded in
providing much faster and often more reliable Internet service,
particularly in rural and regional areas, than the standard
public system telephone network.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are two types of
satellite services you can use: asynchronous and synchronous.
Similar to the asymmetrical DSL service, asynchronous means that
there are different speeds for upstream and downstream traffic
(again, downstream is faster than upstream).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Synchronous satellite services
on the other hand, have the same speed for upstream as for
downstream, which makes it more suitable to services that are
heavily impacted by delays, like video and audio
streaming.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana" color="#990000"><b>Generally
these satellite technologies work on one of two
principles</b></font><font size="-1" face="Verdana">:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">- Data is downloaded from the
satellite to a terrestrial base station and from the base station
to the consumer by microwave link. The consumer requires a
receiving dish or antenna and a standard phone modem for
uploading data to the base station and from there to the
satellite.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">- Data is downloaded directly
to the consumer's satellite dish but a phone modem is still
required to upload data to a terrestrial base station and to the
satellite.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Data download speeds for
consumer systems usually range from 64Kbps to 400Kbps, with
upload transfer rates restricted to the 33Kbps maximum of any
33Kbps or 56Kbps modem. More expensive corporate systems can go
as high at 2Mbps. Speeds can be affected by traffic volume and
even bad weather, and costs vary considerably depending on the
carrier.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>2-way
services</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, recent satellite
technology developments have paved the way for the launch of
broadband satellite service. This service connects the user
 to the Internet via a 2-way satellite connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The 2-way service promises
users download speeds of up to 512Kbps, and upload speeds of
64Kbps or 128Kbps. Unlike the 1-way satellite services mentioned
above, the 2-way service also provides users with an "always on"
connection to the Internet because it no longer requires a
dial-up modem connected to a phone line to upload data. Instead,
the information that is exchanged between the satellite, your
dish and satellite equipment is securely encoded and decoded by a
special satellite modem attached to your PC.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Because 2-way uses a different
satellite to transmit Internet services and requires different
hardware to operate, users with existing 1-way equipment will not
be able to upgrade to the new 2-way product.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Again, like ADSL or cable, the
satellite 2-way service has been designed to only support
a single computer connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Wireless</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Wireless broadband services are
centred around the IEEE 802.11 standard.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Lucent Technologies, Nortel
Networks and Symbol Technologies worked with the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE; www.iee.org) to
create the IEEE 802.11 specification for use with wireless area
networks. There are currently four specifications in the family:
802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The most widely deployed of
these today is 802.11b (often called Wi-Fi), which runs on the
public 2.4GHz spectrum and is capable of data speeds of up to
11Mbps over a range of up to 150m.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">This data-only system utilises
a small base station connected to a wired network or to the
Internet and transmits data wirelessly to multiple workstations,
which can be desktops, laptops or even handheld PCs. Each base
station can service several users equipped with wireless receiver
cards in their computer, and base stations can be overlapped to
allow several hundred users to access the network or
Internet.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">But while 802.11b has gained
the most popularity of the wireless services, the first Wi-Fi5 or
802.11a certifications for wireless LAN access points and cards
are out in October 2002. 802.11a uses the 5GHz waveband and
promises speeds of up to 54Mbps, but is not interoperable with
802.11b.<br>

<blockquote><font size="+1" face="Verdana"><b>Business and
 Home Broadband Access</b></font> 
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The primary differences between
residential and SME/SOHO broadband customers is the criteria they
use to select their service. For SME/SOHO users, performance and
price will be key ingredients in selecting a broadband service,
as well as support for value-added services such as VPNs. Fixed
price packages versus fixed volume also play a role for large or
small businesses. For consumers, it's all about price and
value.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For those who are planning to
use broadband services in a business environment, there are
several differentiators to look out for, particularly in the DSL
space. Business DSL services for example, can include support for
multiple users and tailored network configurations, additional
technical support and a higher level of guaranteed network
performance.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Static and Dynamic IP
addresses</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A key factor for business users
to consider is the static IP address options. To understand why
there are two different ways of assigning IP addresses, it is
important to know what an IP address is used for.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">An IP address is the defining
tag which identifies the host computer on the Internet. This
includes identifying the network being used to access the
Internet, as well as the host computer accessing the data across
that network.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A good way to understand the
difference between a static and dynamic IP address is to compare
a public telephone (dynamic IP) to your home phone (static
IP).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The dynamic IP address is like
a public telephone, as it provides you with a temporary
connection to the Internet for you to download information from.
Once you log off the internet (hang up the phone), you will lose
that particular IP address (phone number) and the IP address will
be thrown back into the network and re-allocated to another user.
The next time you log on to the internet, your ISP will allocate
you a number from its available pool of numbers.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In comparison, a static IP
address is fixed to either or both the sender or receiver of data
across the Internet (much like your permanent home phone number
is allocated to you). With dynamic IP, Web servers will only be
able to locate you through that IP address for that partcular
Internet session. So, if you want to upload information (eg. give
Web servers your IP address so they can contact you, such as with
e-mail or hosting your own Web site), you will need to ensure
whatever service you sign up for provides you with a static IP
address.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">However, having a permanent
connection (by giving other Web servers the ability to locate
you) will pose a greater security risk, so you will need to put
security measures in place, such as firewalls.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Around half of ISPs currently
providing ADSL residential services offer static IP addresses
with some of their plans, but often the monthly rates will be
higher than those offering dynamic IP addresses.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cable providers in the
residential market offer dynamic IP addresses only.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Sharing broadband across
multiple PCs</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There are a number of ways to
share your broadband with multiple computers. These fall into two
categories. The first is a line sharing option provided by the
ISP. This requires additional outlets to be installed in your
home or office for each PC. It is a simple solution that requires
no additional configuration, but is currently only available with
certain cable companies.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The second involves running a
Local Area Network (LAN) in your home or office. It is important
to note that while most ISPs will allow you to run a LAN from a
single connection point on ADSL or cable services, they will not
provide any support for the LAN, and recommend you consult a
communications specialist to set it up for you. In some instances
the ISP may be able to refer you to an appropriate consultant,
but this will depend on the ISP. Some ISP will refer its ADSL
customers wanting to establish a LAN to a professional
third-party consultant, but others do not deal with LAN services
at all.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The other issue with setting up
your own LAN is providing each user with their own e-mail
account. If you want to have multiple user accounts included in
your broadband service but have only signed up as an individual
user with your ISP, you may incur a fee for each additional user
you introduce. For instance, customers who have signed up to the
service as a single user initially, will have to pay extra setup
and ongoing monthly fees for each user account they want to add
on to their service. This means that if you want to have seven
people hooked up on your LAN with different e-mail addresses, you
will need to pay an additional $77 per month ($11 per user
account per month) on top of your monthly service charges to have
the additional user accounts connected. However, other ISPs do
not have this restriction on multiple user accounts. Most will
provide residential subscribers with as many as five e-mail
accounts on its cable service free of charge.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you are going to set up a
LAN on your broadband service, be it cable or ADSL, there are
three main ways of sharing the connection between multiple
PCs.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Firstly, you can use a hardware
router, which is arguably the best solution, although it is also
the most expensive one. Router prices start at a couple of
hundred dollars, and allow you to simply plug your modem into one
side and your PCs into the other and you're away. They handle the
logging-in, line sharing and security without the issues that
plague most of the alternatives, which involve specific hardware
and software configuration, as well as a dependency upon a single
server PC.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">DSL router Option two is to use
a proxy server, which is a piece of software that runs on the PC
that is connected to the modem. In addition to proxy software,
you will need a network card and cable for each computer as well
as a network hub. For cable, this requires that the server PC has
two network cards - one for the modem and one for the LAN. ADSL
users have the additional option of plugging the modem directly
into the uplink port on the hub (using a special crossover
cable).</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once you have your hardware
sorted, there are plenty of proxy server software packages
available. Many of these are freeware (such as AnalogX at
www.analogx.com), but most are inadequate if you want to do more
than just surf the Web and read e-mail. Those that are suitable
for using with other applications such as IRC, gaming, instant
messaging, FTP and peer to peer networking will usually involve a
fair amount of configuration and trial and error to get working
properly. If you have an old, unused PC, it might be worth
considering using it as a dedicated proxy server. Using software
such as Smoothwall (http://www.smoothwall.org/), you can quickly
and easily configure it to run as a standalone proxy server
without the need for a Windows licence (as it is Linux based) or
any other cost, aside from a network card.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The benefit of using a proxy
server is primarily the level of control you have over how PCs on
your LAN connect to the Internet. The downside is that each
Internet application on each client PC must be configured to use
the proxy. If you are running Windows 95 or you want to keep your
LAN secure and undetectable, then a proxy is probably the best
way to share your connection. If you are running a later version
of Windows, or Linux, or your PCs are going to be using Internet
applications such as instant messaging and multiplayer games,
then using Network Address Translation may be a better option for
you.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Option three is to use Network
Address Translation (NAT). This is commonly done using Internet
Connection Sharing (ICS) built into Windows 98, ME, 2000 and XP.
Linux users will need to configure ipchains or install something
like freesco (http://www.freesco.org) to utilise connection
sharing via NAT. This option is transparent to users on your
network as it involves each computer being assigned an IP address
by the ISP. So if your ISP doesn't allow you to use LANs, then
this is not really an option. The benefit of NAT is that it
requires almost no configuration at all and allows you to use all
your PCs as if they were directly connected to the modem. As per
the proxy server option, you will need a network card and cable
for each computer as well as a network hub. You will also need an
additional network card for the server PC unless you are using
ADSL and choose to connect the modem to the hub with a crossover
cable.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is worth bearing in mind
that of all the options available, the last two are limited by
the fact that if the computer connected to the modem crashes or
is shut down, the Internet connection will be unavailable. If you
use a router or have multiple outlets installed, then all your
PCs are online all the time, and none are dependent on the others
working correctly.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Running a server on your
computer</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most broadband packages do not
allow you to run server software from any computer connected to
your modem, be they Web, FTP, e-mail or other type of server.
Those that do usually involve your server being assigned a static
IP address. Essentially, this means that your computer's online
location will be predetermined. Therefore, a static IP address is
useful because it allows it to be mapped to a domain name in the
DNS. So, for example, if you want to run a Web server for
www.yourname.com.au from your home or office, you need to have a
static IP that can be mapped to that domain name in order to make
it visible on the Internet. If you haven't specifically requested
an IP address from your ISP, then you will almost certainly be on
a plan that dynamically assigns you an IP each time you log on
with your modem.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">It is possible, though, to have
a domain name mapped to your computer even if you are assigned an
IP address dynamically. The general name given to this technique
is Dynamic DNS, or DDNS. To use DDNS, you need to use a service
provider such as dynIP.org or cjb.net, which require you to
install client software on your PC. The function of this software
is to broadcast your PC's IP address to the DDNS server, allowing
your IP address to change without your domain name seemingly
disappearing from the Net.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you run remote access
software such as pcAnywhere or VNC, then a dynamic DNS service
such as those mentioned may be quite useful if you want to access
your desktop from the Internet.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>A back-up plan</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Although broadband operators
have a scheme to refund their Internet clients for network
outages, this doesn't solve the problem of what to do when your
broadband connection goes down. So if you're moving from a
regular dialup modem, our advice is not to uninstall it. Chances
are it will come in handy when you need to send an e-mail or use
the Web but you can't connect because the ADSL network is down.
Remember, DSL is still a newly installed technology to some
operators may have a few hitches during their initial roll-out
phase.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you use your modem to send
and receive faxes, then bear in mind that broadband won't replace
this particular function at all. If you have a second phone line
that was dedicated to the modem, then you can probably justify
ditching it and sharing the one line for the phone and
modem.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A good backup plan for times
when your broadband service goes down may be to find an ISP that
offers a prepaid dialup account. This way you're not locked into
a monthly fee for a service you rarely need, but when you do, you
only pay for what you use.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Security</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Whenever you are accessing the
Internet you are exposing your computer to potential risk.
Because people don't tend to stay too long on a PC when they have
dial-up connections, most don't pay that much attention to the
threat. Many users are savvy
when it comes to security, installing not only antivirus software
but firewalls as well. Zone Alarm is the clear favourite if
HelpScreen is a judge &#8211; largely because it is free (there
is a Pro version which has more features, but this incurs a cost)
and very effective.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The importance of a firewall
when you are connected to a broadband service cannot be stressed
enough. Unlike dial-up, where a user can disconnect their
Internet connection and then in an inadvertent way also secure
their PC because they are offline, broadband users don't have
that luxury. They are exposed to the Net's nasties continously.
So when you are not monitoring your computer, why not get
software to do it for you. It is up to you whether you want to
use a free Firewall or pay for one &#8211; most of the antivirus
vendors offer some sort of firewall. But whatever the case,
install it. Having a broadband connection without a Firewall is
an invite to security incursions.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
 <font size="+1" face="Verdana"><b>Other Questions to Ask the
ISP</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Is this service available in
my area?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The best way to check whether a
broadband service is available in your area is via an ISP's Web
site. One way to do this, for example, is to enter your phone
number or postcode in the ISP facilities on their Web sites which
will allow you to see whether you can receive their chosen
services.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For a complete list of
broadband providers in the world, check out the broadband Choice
Web site: www.Broadbandchoice.com.au.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>How much does it cost to
install?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Installation prices will depend
on a range of conditions, including whether you install the
service yourself or opt for a technician; how long you sign up to
the plan; what modem you choose (for example,<br>
 if you select a 1 or 4 port ADSL modem, or if you buy a modem
independently of the ISP) and any additional equipment you
need<br>
 (such as a Ethernet card, additional phone line filters or
splitter).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Self-installation
packages</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Several broadband ISPs have
also been actively promoting self-installation ADSL packages,
which not only save subscribers from the hassle of waiting for a
professional technician to come out to their home, but also
reduce the cost of installing ADSL services.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">To give an example, a new range
of self-installation packages for 1 and 4 port ADSL services are
available, which take money off the price of having the service
installed by a professional. These savings are based on
subscribers installing the modem and service themselves. Users
will be charged an additional fee to have the service installed
by a technician. Prices are again on an ISP-by-ISP basis, so
check out some of their Web sites for more details on
professional versus self-install charges.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>ADSL broadband in a box ADSL
router</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A range of ADSL services have
now been introduced as bundled broadband packages available from
retailers shelves. Much like purchasing a pre-paid mobile phone,
these broadband in a box bundles provide subscribers with an
approved selection of modems, service plan, and one fixed IP
address and are targeted at home and SME users. If you're
confident you can install the service yourself, or you need the
static IP address, this option may be a good one for
you.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>What are the download limits
per month?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Most broadband services are now
capped at a certain amount of download capacity per month, which
means you will be charged an additional amount for any excess
downloads (usually around 15 cents per megabyte). Some service
providers, however, offer uncapped plans which do not charge for
additional usage, but instead reduce in speed as users exceed
their monthly limit. This is worth looking into if you think you
are likely to go over your specified download limit.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The download limit is
determined by the plan you sign up for. Plans for both ADSL
services and cable in the residential space range from 300MB
download limits per month, to up to 10GB (and of course, the more
download bandwidth you require, the higher the monthly usage
charge). Make sure you check these limits thoroughly before
subscribing to a service.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Note: Some ISPs will also
charge for upstream traffic. If you are planning to upload a lot
of data onto the Internet (running a Web site for example),
you're best to check out what the ISP's policy is regarding
uploading information before you sign on the dotted
line.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Why are download limits so
high?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You will find that when you
exceed a download limit and then start paying by the megabyte the
normal fee hovers around the 15 cent mark &#8211; but this varies
with some operators charging slightly more. The main reason for
this is because the most Internet traffic in the world is
directed at US sites. The problem with this is that the cost of
sending information undersea is expensive. So these high tariffs
imposed by the undersea cable operators are then passed onto to
the broadband service provider who then passes these on to
users.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>What is the acceptable use
policy?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">With most Internet services,
subscribers are expected to sign a contract to cover the usage of
these services. When signing up to a broadband service, this is
known as an acceptable use policy. In other words it is a code of
conduct.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Some of the conditions
subscribers must adhere to when signing such a policy is not to
knowingly transmit a computer virus or disrupt the network,
illegal acts such as accessing another person's computer system
or sending bulk unsolicited e-mail. A copy of the ISP's
acceptable use policy should be available on their Web
site.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>What service level
guarantees (if any) do you supply with this
service?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the residential broadband
space, very few ISPs provide service level guarantees for their
ADSL broadband service. Business plans will tend to offer a more
reliable service, and guarantee a certain level of performance
from the network. This guarantee will be up to the ISP. Most of
the equipment provided by the ISP will be covered by a warranty
(the length of which will depend on the contract you have signed
up for).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>What level of customer
support do I receive?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Again, this will depend on the
individual ISP, as well as the plan you select. Business
customers can expect a higher level of support than residential
users, but they will pay more for the privilege.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>How long does it take to
install?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For DSL services, ISPs suggest
it will take around 15 working days to have the entire
installation process completed (this can however, stretch out to
four weeks depending on the availability of the required modem,
or the number of subscribers in the queue to be connected). Note:
broadband in a box customers are also subject to these waiting
times. Cable customers on the other hand are able to hop onto the
service immediately after it has been installed.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Do I get a discount if I
already have an existing phone account?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">ISPs that offer other services
such as Internet or telephony often have special deals in place
for existing customers who want to sign up to broadband, so it's
worth checking these out to see what kind of deal you are
entitled to. For example, customers can receive discounts on the
monthly costs for broadband services if they have existing
telephony accounts or cable TV. Other ISPs may waive the costs of
installing the service if you are already a dial-up
customer.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>How long is the service
plan?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The length of the service plan
you select can also have a bearing on the amount you pay for the
installation of the service. Generally, the longer the contract,
the cheaper the cost of installation will be (the difference
between a three month and 18 month contract can be over $100).
Bear in mind, if you wish to cancel the service, ISPs will charge
a cancellation fee (this is usually worked out on the proportion
of months you had remaining on the contract &#8211; much like a
mobile phone bill).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Verdana"><b>What system requirements do
I need?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana" color="#CC0000"><b>- ADSL
system requirements</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">For a PC connection, you will
need a 200MHz or higher Pentium processor, with a Windows
operating system (with the exception of a very few who can
support Windows 95, you will need Windows 98 S.E. or up). The
amount of RAM you require to run the service will depend on the
operating system you use: for example, users with Windows 98 will
need 16MB &#8211; 64MB of RAM, while Windows 2000 and ME users
will need 64MB RAM. All users will also need between 20MB - 150MB
of free hard disk space, as well as either a USB or Ethernet port
(depending on the modem).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Mac users are recommended to
have a Power PC or iMac, and require 20MB free hard disk space as
well as an Ethernet connection. Mac OS users will need 12MB RAM,
while Mac OSX users will require 128MB RAM in order to access an
ADSL service.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Both Mac and PC users need to
have a CDROM drive for the installation software.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana" color="#CC0000"><b>- Cable
system requirements</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">System requirements for cable
services are similar, and Windows users will need a system with
similar RAM specifications as those mentioned above. Cable
services will require 125MB &#8211; 150MB of free hard disk space
(although some Windows XP users with cable plan will need 500MB
of free hard disk space). All cable modems for Windows connect
through to your PC via either a PCI slot or USB port, so users
will also need to have a spare USB port, while Macintosh users
will need to have an Ethernet connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>- Can I use
Linux?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Cable and ADSL providers do not
officially support Linux, but that doesn't mean you can't use the
service with this operating system.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Some cable services use DHCP to
allocate IP addresses to users. DHCP is a standard protocol for
allocating IP addresses on Ethernet networks, and has been used
in small and large office networks for years. All you need to do
to switch your broadband service to your Linux computer is
configure a UNIX DHCP client with the correct DHCP id.You also
need to ensure your network card is set up correctly for
Linux.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Some cable users will need to
configure their Linux machines for unique home-grown protocols.
These programs provide user/password login control, as well as
regular network checks, but was designed for the officially
supported platforms only &#8211; not Linux.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While Linux is not officially
supported by ISPs offering ADSL services, the PPPoE protocol
(more on this below) used in ADSL technology to connect users to
the service is well supported by Linux. Again, it's just a matter
of configuring the PPPoE client to suit your Linux set
up.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>What modem should I choose?
(ADSL) 4-port ADSL modem</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">External ADSL modems are
available with two network interfaces: USB or Ethernet. USB
compliant modems allow users to connect the modem to their PC via
a USB port, while Ethernet-based modems connect up via the PC's
Ethernet port. (Note: users will also need a network card to
support an Ethernet modem).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">While your choice of modem will
effect the cost of your ADSL installation, modems can also play a
suprisingly influential role in the security of your high-speed
connection. Some ADSL modems for example, offer additional
features, such as built-in firewalls or PPPoE clients.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you are going to bring your
own modem, be wary that ISPs will not let you use any old modem;
you will need to buy a product approved by the ISP. This will
also mean that your modem will not be covered by any warranty
from the ISP. In addition, some ISPs will not allow you to bring
along your own modem &#8211; you will only be able to get the
modem available at the time of installation.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Another thing consumers should
be aware of is that not all ISPs offer modems with their services
&#8211; and in some cases, the use of the modem is on a rental
basis. This means that if you want to cease services with one ISP
and join another before your contract is up, you will be expected
to return the modem to your original ISP. Make sure you check the
conditions of modem use before signing up to any
plans.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Before we leave this point, it
is important to stress the importance of the modem as a security
measure. If possible, do not skimp on the modem. Security is a
big issue with broadband (see Security) and if you install a
modem with a in-built Firewall &#8211; and there are many
available today, you are cutting down the risk to your
information from the outside world considerably.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once the modem is connected and
you have confirmation from your ISP that the service has been
connected at their end, install the software, enter your username
and password through the PPPoE client (see glossary for more
details) and you're online.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>PPPoE client<br>
<br>
</b> PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is a
specification for connecting multiple computer users on an
Ethernet local area network to a remote site through a modem or
similar device. This client is used by ADSL service providers to
authenticate their customers on the network.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">During an initial exchange
between the PC and the remote site (or ISP), the PPPoE client
learns the network address and allocates the dynamic or random IP
addresses assigned to a user each time they authenticate to a
broadband service. When an Internet session ends, that IP address
goes back into the pool and gets allocated to someone
else.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">As the PPPoE client is a
generic program, users do not have to stick with the client
packaged alongside their broadband service. A list of PPPoE
clients can be obtained by doing a Google search. Some PPPoE
clients are listed at
http://www.carricksolutions.com/pppoe.htm#38.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Unlike dial-up connections, DSL
and cable modem connections are "always on". Since a number of
different users are sharing the same physical connection to the
remote service provider, a method is needed to keep track of user
traffic, including which user should be billed. Once a session is
established between an individual user and the ISP, the session
can be monitored for billing purposes.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Because it is similar to the
client used for dial-up, PPPoE clients are exposed to the same
amount of vulnerability to attack.<br>
