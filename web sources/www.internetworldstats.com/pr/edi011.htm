<p><font face="Arial">Hello and a great welcome to all
subscribers.<br>
<br>
 One of the words that has always fascinated me has been
"synergy". Very few people pay due attention to synergies in the
Internet. This has to do with win-win situations. Synergies have
to be taken into account in all marketing efforts, online as well
as off-line.<br>
<br>
 We are happy to inform you that Internet usage and broadband
access continue to grow worldwide. Today there are over 964
million documented Internet users worldwide. With this huge
number of people in the Internet, there must be much potential
for finding synergy. Success, riches and fame await for the lucky
entrepreneurs that find sinergies and can make them work.<br>
<br>
 Another example of good synergy is between the</font> <a href=

site and our new web site</font> <a href=

face="Arial">All About Market Research</font></a><font face=

<br>
 Traditional market research principles and good old common sense
should always be your main guiding forces in e-Business,
e-Marketing and e-Commerce.<br>

Demographics<br>
</b></font> <font face="Arial">Global Internet usage is estimated
at 964,289,701, equivalent to 15% of the world population, as of
October 31/05 by</font> <a href=

face="Arial">. This figure takes us closer to the one billion
target at the end of 2005.<br>
<br>
 Please take note that the statistics for Europe have changed
greatly because Turkey has been included among the European
countries. This change was made considering the fact that Turkey
is a candidate state for joining the European Union. The Middle
East region reflects a decrease for this reason as well. The

Internet usage growth of 444% in the</font> <a href=

considered a positive factor towards obtaining European Union
membership, for implementing the changes required, and for
enjoying the benefits that this alliance will bring to the people
in these countries.<br>

Kingdom</b></font><br>
 <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2005/07/nr_20050713"
target="_blank"><font face="Arial">Ofcom</font></a><font face=
"Arial">, the regulator and competition authority for the UK
communications industries, has informed in its second annual
Communications Market report, a range of new trends in broadband,
digital broadcasting and other communications services. For
broadband, these include the following:<br>
<br>
 1 - For the first time in the UK, there are now more households
with broadband than dial-up Internet connections. 2005 was the
year in which broadband became a genuinely mainstream consumer
product, now present in almost 30% of all UK households and
businesses and actively considered by many more.</font> 
<p><font face="Arial">2 - The number of new broadband connections
per week has increased almost fifteen-fold in three years - from
5,500 per week in 2001 to 73,800 per week in 2004. This rapid
acceleration in take-up has led to a (provisional) total of 8.1
million connections as of June 2005, more than double the number
of connections at the end of 2003. By the end of 2005, 99.6% of
UK homes will be connected to a broadband-enabled
exchange.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3 - Average broadband connection speeds are
also increasing. At the end of 2002, a 512kps connection
typically cost &pound;27 a month; as a result of greater
competition between providers, a 1 Mbps connection now costs
&pound;20 a month.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">4 - The combination of mass-market appeal,
rapid growth, falling prices, increasing connection speeds and
innovation in video technology means that by 2010, the number of
households able to view television over broadband is likely to
exceed the number of households dependent on analogue terrestrial
broadcasts for all their television viewing. For further
coverage, please visit the</font> <a href=

"_blank"><font face="Arial">Ofcom</font></a> <font face=
"Arial">web site.<br>
<br>
 Nielsen//NetRatings, leading provider of Internet research,
confirms the increasing take-up of broadband in the UK. Almost
three quarters of Briton&rsquo;s (73%) now access the Internet
from home using broadband compared to 46% this time last year, a
growth of 59% according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Additionally, the
broadband users spend twice as long on their computers and view
3.5 times as many web-pages each month as narrowband users.

developing communication technology that delivers very high-speed
network data rates, at very high power levels.<br>
<br>
 The ultra wideband radio transmitters and receivers will send
wireless signals through the natural-gas pipe at the same time
the pipe is delivering gas fuel. The company claims its
technology will be able to offer 100 megabits per second to every
home, which is more than enough to provide voice, video and
high-speed Internet access, at lower costs.<br>
