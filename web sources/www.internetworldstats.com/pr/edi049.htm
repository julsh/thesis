<p><font face="Arial">Dear Subscriber,</font>,<br>
<font face="Arial">The year 2010 is special for us, and specially for the writer, because
 it marks an aniversary for our research work: Ten years delivering the Internet World Stats statistics
 to the global community. Yes, ten years (2000 - 2010) of work in the Internet research and
 web publishing field for the <b>Miniwatts Marketing Group</b>.<br>
<br>To allow fair comparison between countries, since the very begining and also for
 practical purposes, we established the year 2000 as the baseline for calculating Internet
 user growth. This has worked out nicely. Another thing we decided back in 2000 that
 remains unchanged and still works fine is the use of the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/english_country_names_and_code_elements.htm">
 <b>ISO 3166</b></a> code system for identifying the world countries and territories.<br>
<br>Using the <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm"><b>United Nations</b></a>
 country clasification system for grouping all the countries and territories within the
 world regions works fine. The source for world population statistics, however, did change.
 We now use the <a href="http://www.census.gov/"><b>U.S. Census Bureau</b></a>
 as source for world population statistics. There is a definite advantage in using
 for our work generally accepted world Standards.<br>
<br>The Statistical Tables have remained basically unchanged, as to the look, design
 and colors. Nothing fancy, but practical and easy to understand. The bar and pie
 charts graphics were a good addition to the website. These graphic elements make
 the statistics easier to understand and less boring to look at.<br>
<br>
 Another feature that has remained unchanged from the start is our firm decision to
 publish the stats in the web and allow free access to them for everybody. This policy
 will remain in effect for as long as we can finance the research and cover the
 associated publishing expenses with the website advertising revenue.<br>
<br>You may wonder about the practical applications of the Internet
 World Stats. Well, one of the main uses for them is to evaluate the market potencial
 for the individual countries. Knowing the Internet Indicators for a country or region, 
 makes it easy to determine the possibilities of doing e-commerce, the potencial market
 size, and other marketing data.<br> 
<br>Regarding the final 2009 Year-end Internet World Stats, we are working on them
 and they will be available very soon at the website.</font>
