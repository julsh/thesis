   	    <h1>History of barter: how the barter system evolved to what  it is today</h1>
         <p>The barter system that we  use today is incredibly popular. However, few realize just how far back the  barter system goes. <strong>The history of  barter as an exchange of goods and services may surprise you with its  complexity</strong>. Bartering has typically not been the only method of exchange of  goods and services that a society used, since it can’t operate by itself. The  barter system was used as a complement to another economic system and bartering  was traditionally done by strangers or enemies. Bartering has evolved today  into a legitimate method of exchange of goods and services. </p>
         <p>One of the first evidences  of bartering is in <strong>6000 BC</strong>. The  barter system traded all sorts of goods and services, such as weaponry, food,  or tea. One problem that was discovered with the barter system in areas such as  Mesopotamia was that there was no way to assign a specific value to the goods  and services that were being traded.  One  of the <strong>most popular things traded in the  barter system was salt</strong>, because it was so valuable. </p>
         <p><a href="index.html" title="Bartering">Bartering</a> grew and flourished as people began to travel more during the Middle Ages. The  barter system began to be more successful as there were new goods and services  being introduced. The Europeans introduced new things into the barter system  market that Americans didn’t have access to and also didn’t have the money to  afford. </p>
         <p>During the Great  Depression, the barter system began to grow even more rapidly than it had been.  The Great Depression is one of the most significant time periods throughout the  history of bartering. Money was scarce and people had a difficult time getting  what they needed. It allowed people to get food or clothing when they needed to  and they were allowed to create accounts with businesses. </p>
         <p><strong>Today, <a href="barter-new-york.html" title="barter in New York">barter in New  York</a> is highly sophisticated when you compare it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter#History" title="history of bartering" target="_blank">history of bartering</a></strong>. Throughout the history of business, barter in New  York has been used as a way to get goods and services that you may not have the  cash for at the moment. Another popular barter method is online and that  popularity continues to increase.  </p>
         <p>Every business owner has  periods of lower profits, but they still need to get what they need for the  business to grow. People <a href="what-can-you-barter.html" title="what can you barter">can trade excess  goods or free time for barter dollars</a> and save those dollars for a time  they are needed. If you barter in New York through an agency, you can save your  dollars. Since barter has evolved to what it is today, you can save the dollars  or services you bartered for and use them during the difficult times you may  face. </p>
