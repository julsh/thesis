<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">TORONTO STAR</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sunday July 20, 1993</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">BARTER</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">WHEN MONEY IS TIGHT, TRADING GOODS AND
SERVICES IS ONE WAY TO BOOST THE</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">LOCAL ECONOMY</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">THEY PLAN TO CREATE JOBS USING BARTERED
TIME</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Back when times were good, Doug Brennner
couldn't have told you the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">difference between a GreenDollar and a
loonie. That's because Brenner</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">had lots and lots of loonies: In 1989,
he sold $2.8 million in Ralph</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lauren Polo pants, GUESS shirts, Ocean
Pacific bathing suits and what</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">he calls 'Yuppie-brand-name clothes."
His personal income from his</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">nine retail clothing stores, some with
catchy names like</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Boomer Club, was more than $100,000
that year.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But when the recession hit, clothing sales
dropped. His business went</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">into bankruptcy in 1991, throwing 50 staffers
into unemployment and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">forcing Brenner to begin looking for a
way out of the proverbial hole.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was at a support group for the unemployed
earlier this year that he</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">heard about the GreenDollar system, a
form of barter which some see as</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">an innovative economic shot in Toronto
Local Employment and Trading</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">System, or LETS system. However, GreenDollar
systems or LETSystems are</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">better known in Australia, New Zealand
and England.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And they really aren't so new. Toronto
author Jane Jacobs, an expert</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on the economic role of cities, terms
them the most ancient form of</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">trading."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Money is very convenient," she says.
"But when there is not enough</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">money - as there is in a recession - barter,
or local trading with</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">some kind of local currency or accounting
system in place, gets people</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">using their skills . . . It encourages
them to develop new skills. It</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">also fosters honesty and it brings people
in a com-munity together,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">neighbors get to know each other. It's
a kind of homemade safety net."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the founders of the Toronto LETSystem,
Dr. David Burman, sees a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">connection between it and improved public
health.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It helps create an environment in which
people can be well," says</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Burman, who has a Ph.D. in community health
and is also a Metro</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">dentist.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We've seen the connection between unemployment
and heart disease;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we've seen the connection between unemployment
and violence. This</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">helps get people out of that cycle," he
says, adding that the system</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">has the "potential to change the social
environment from one of</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">scarcity in which people are always looking
over their shoulders to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">one of abundance where people feel like
giving.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Toronto system started three years..
ago with five people. Today,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it has 325 members who exchange among
themselves using computer</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">credits called GreenDollars.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Those using the system can receive real
dollars plus Green ones, which</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">they usually do because taxes are paid
just as if one is using real</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">money. Some transactions may be paid for
entirely in green. But again,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">according to Revenue Canada, income generated
in Greendollars is</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">taxable if it is earned as part of your
usual profession.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The beauty of this is that people don't
have to have any GreenDollars</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">when they join ... they create GreenDollars
themselves by spending</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">them," says Sat Khalsa, administrator
of LETS in Toronto.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I've been able to go to a chiropractor
and have massages," says</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Burman who in turn accepts 25 per cent
of his fee for dental work in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GreenDollars. Rev. Lindsay King of Willowdale
United Church, another</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">member of the system, recently had a deck
built using GreenDollars.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He, in turn, offers counselling.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One can also get a haircut, have the house
cleaned, take saxophone</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">lessons; there is even a a room for rent,
$65 pet week - 50 percent</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Green - on the LETS Notice board, a list
of goods and services, which</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">every member receives monthly.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Doug Coyle, Ontario director of the GreenDollar
system, sees the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">concept as similar to that of Canadian
Tire offering Canadian Tire</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Money to encourage customers to spend
at its stores.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A lot of businesses are offering such
incentives," he says. Ours is a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">kind of community currency, it doesn't
go away. It stays in the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">community to keep people working.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is nothing but positive that can
come of it says Jacobs.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But she says governments sometimes are
reluctant to endorse the system</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">because it's feared they miss out on local
taxes.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"However, what governments fail to see
is that the system teaches</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">people to act on their own behalf and
may ultimately help them to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">depend less on the government welfare
or other types of financial</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">support."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">About the only thing that can go wrong
with a LETSystem is that people</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">stop participating and the system shuts
down. That's what happened</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">with Canada's first LETSystem which British-born
Michael Linton formed</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on Vancouver Island in 1983.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Linton, who came to Canada in 1975 worked
as a physical therapist</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">until the early 1980s when the recession
hit. Faced with unemployment,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Linton recalled a lecture he had attended
many years earlier at</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cambridge University in England.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The speaker had talked about how illogical
it was for people to be out</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of work during recessions because even
in tough times, there are</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">people with skills. There is work to be
done. The only obstacle is a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">lack of cash.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In other societies, if a road needed to
be built and there were</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">skilled people, they didn't stand around
lamenting the lack of money.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They simply got together and built the
road. This kind of reasoning</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">made sense to Linton and to the approximately
700 people who joined</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that system over the next three years
and ultimately traded $300,000</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in goods and services.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The recession was what got it going,"
says Linton's wife Shirley. But</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by 1986, when it ceased to function, there
was enough real currency</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">around so that people didn't have the
incentive to use the system.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It's a confidence situation," she says.
"People really have to be</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">willing to network to make it work."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Shirley Wade Linton recently started a
new LETSystem for women in her</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">community. Her husband, meanwhile, is
in Australia, on a trip paid for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by the Western Australian government,
helping l communities establish</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">LETSystems.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Australian and New Zealand governments
have each given some</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">$50,000 to local communities to begin
and promote LETSystems.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Michigan, Missouri and Florida, state
governments are also funding</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">local Time Dollar systems (similar to
the LETSystems), says Khalsa.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unfortunately, Canadian LETS organizers
have not enjoyed the same</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">success with our governments.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The government is so obsessed with big
issues the overlook small</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">things like LETSystems," says Khalsa.
"There are lingering doubts in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">people's minds .... people think this
is so great the government is</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">going to crack down and put a stop to
this."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Khalsa says that while Revenue Canada
is quite clear on what taxes one</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">must pay in the system, LETS organizers
have no clear idea about what</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">happens to someone receiving unemployment
insurance who earns</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GreenDollars. Does one declare them just
as one does real currency?</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An official with Employment and Immigration
Canada told The Star</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">anyone receiving unemployment insurance
benefits would indeed have to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">report GreenDollars as income.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Despite much concerted effort, .. (from
LETS organizers in Ontario,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Manitoba and Saskatchewan) we haven't
been able to get this resolved</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and we haven't been able to get governments
to support us," says</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Khalsa.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Official support would help bring more
people into the LETSystem, said</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Brenner, who is trying to get backing
from the town of Newmarket and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">its chamber of commerce.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although Newmarket Mayor Ray Twinney has
given the system his</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">tentative approval, he says he is waiting
for a recommendation from</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the chamber before officially endorsing
it.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The chamber, which represents 400 small
businesses, meanwhile, has set</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">up a subcommittee to study the issue and
is expected to make</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">recommendations to its membership at a
meeting late next month.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Newmarket (pop. 48,000) is feeling the
effects of the recession just</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">as many other towns are, says Brenner
who closed three of his stores</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in the Upper Canada Mall, the town's largest
commercial centre. "Those</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">stores are still empty today," he says.
"Business is slow here."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A lot of Newmarket people work in Toronto
and also send their money in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Toronto, all of which hurts Newmarket
business, says Brenner. But the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GreenDollar System has the potential to
turn that around.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We're not trying to replace Canadian
currency; rather, we're looking</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at helping ourselves and helping the local
economy," says Brenner.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"People would trade with local people;
these GreenDollars can't be</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">used in Toronto or anywhere else and that
helps people here."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Meanwhile Gail Vaughan of the Newmarket
office of the Canadian Mental</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Health Association says the system has
the potential to counteract</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">some of the "feelings of hopelessness,
" in the community,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She's seen the effectiveness of such a
system in Spring, Texas, a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">bedroom community near Houston, where
she, her husband and three</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">children lived between '79 and'83.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It was similar to the Newmarket-Toronto
situation," she says. "There</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was a terrible number of empty stores.
It was very hard for small</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">businesses to compete so close to a major
city."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To protect and encourage the local Spring
economy, local people</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">started TRADELINE, which functioned similarly
to the GreenDollar</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">system.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We knew we might get something cheaper
in Houston, but instead of</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">going there we use TRADELINE," says Vaughan.
"It was great. My husband</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was able to get a crown for his tooth.
We could go out to restaurants,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we had our dryer fixed. We bought a stereo,
TV, jewelry and drugstore</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">items . . . there was no end to what we
could do. . . ."</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In return, Vaughan's husband did autobody
work. She made crafts. When</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the Newmarket system gets going, she figures
she could do newsletters.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"For young people, It's especially hard
not to feel hopeless," she</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">says. "This encourages people to become
entrepreneurs. It gives people</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">some incentive, some hope that they can
do something."</font>
