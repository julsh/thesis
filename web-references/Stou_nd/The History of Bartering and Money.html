Before we go back to thebeginning of money, let's look briefly at the history of money in theU.S. (More details are given later in the chapter.)</P><OL>   <LI>The colonial era. During the 17th and 18th centuries, money   was scarce, so the colonists relied primarily on bartering, with   commodities such as beaver pelts, corn, musket balls, nails,   tobacco, and deer skins (from which we get our modern slang,   "buck," meaning "dollar"). Colonists also used the money of other   cultures -- the Native Americans' wampum, (which consisted of   beads made from shells), and the coins of foreign countries.      <LI>The Great Depression. During the1930s, money was scarce.   People established barter groups like The Unemployed Citizens   League of Denver (with 34,000 members) and the National   Development Association.      <LI>The early 1980s. During a long recession, bartering regained   popularity; it was featured in many magazine articles and many new   books. Hundreds of barter clubs were created throughout the   nation. More companies learned about the the advertising   industry's "trade-outs," and international commerce's   "countertrade," and the other possibilities for bartering in   business. &nbsp;</OL><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="a.gif" WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P><P><A NAME="The history of money -- step by step."></A>The history ofmoney -- step by step. Please note the theme of this story: as ourmoney has evolved, it has become increasingly abstracted from a basisin the tangible value of usable goods and services.</P><OL>   <LI>Direct barter. In the beginning of mankind, there was,   obviously, no money. People traded items which had a practical   value: food items (e.g., cattle, fishes), decorative items (e.g.,   gold, shells), apparel (e.g., furs, cloth), tools, weapons, etc.   However, in direct trades, both parties must have what the other   person wants. For example, the cavewoman possessed blackberries,   which the caveman craved, and he had the arrowheads which she   needed. However, if he wanted berries, but she didn't want his   arrowheads, then no trade could occur.      <LI>"Media of value." For example, a man might have traded his   handcrafted spear for a pile of corn (even though he didn't like   corn) just because he knew that he could then trade the corn to a   woman for some animal skins (which he wanted). These trades were a   step toward the idea of abstract money; the objects weren't valued   for themselves, but for what they could get.      <LI><I>Standard</I> media of value. Gradually, particular   commodities began to be treated as the standards against which we   would determine the value of other items; for example, there might   have been a "wampum standard" (analogous to a "gold standard" in   modern society).&nbsp;To help people to understand this   abstraction of value, these early forms of money were practical   items; for example, the gold could be used either as a medium of   exchange or it could be melted into jewelry. We can still see this   type of correlation, in our terminology:      <UL>      <LI>Salary. This word originates in the Latin word, "sal," from      which we derive the words "salt" and "salary." Salt was used to      pay the wages of Roman soldiers; today, we might say that an      employee is "not worth his salt."            <LI>Pecuniary. This word originates in the word, "pekus," which      refers to oxen. (Webster's Dictionary defines "pecuniary" as      "taking the form of or consisting of money." )            <LI>Capital. This word originates in a word which means      "cattle." (We have the same derivation for the word "chattel,"      which refers generally to personal property.)            <LI>Wealth. In the Chinese language, almost every word related      to "wealth" is a sign for a shell (which has been form of money      in many societies).   </UL>      <LI>Metal as a standard of value. Metal was more practical than   other forms of primitive money: it had a practical value (for use   in jewelry, etc.); it was small enough to transport in one's   pocket (unlike, say, an equally valuable horse); it did not die   like cattle; it was durable (i.e., it did not decay or break). By   2500 BC, the Egyptians were "spending" copper rings like money;   Babylonia had a well-developed barter system based on barley and   uncoined silver hundreds of years before coins were adopted.      <LI>Metal in early coins. Unfortunately, gold dust, gold objects,   and other metals had to be weighed each time they were "spent." To   avoid that task, people began to shape the metals into   standardized sizes to establish fixed values; this was the   beginning of the use of coins. However, people were unaccustomed   to coins, so some of them were given names and shapes which   referred directly to tangible objects:      <UL>      <LI>The names of coins. For example, even today, we refer to      the <I>weight </I>of the metal in words such as lira, ruble,      shekel, drachma, mark, and pound; the "pound" was originally      worth one <I>pound </I>of sterling silver.            <LI>The shapes of coins. For example, the ancient Egyptians      traded with sheep; therefore, when they began to use gold as      money, they fashioned the gold into the shape of small sheep.      In China, the people had been using metal tools as standards of      exchange; eventually, they started to make miniaturized bronze      tools to be used as a type of coin.   </UL>      <LI>Standardization of coins. Coins were probably invented   independently in China, India, and in a nation called Lydia, which   is now a part of Turkey. Around 600 BC, those Lydian coins were   bean-shaped nuggets made of a mixture of silver and gold; a   stamped design on the coins indicated that they were, indeed,   coins of uniform size. No longer did people in that country have   to weigh their metals to determine the value. When other nations   heard about this new standard for commerce, they developed coins   of their own -- like the early Roman coins, which were made of   silver, copper, or gold. Although coins were an abstraction of   value, the metal still had a practical value of its own; for   example, the gold coins could be melted down and made into a   necklace. However, the <I>abstraction</I> of value permitted   abuse: when people became accustomed to using coins, the kings who   owned the mints began to reduce the proportion of precious metal   in each coin. This trick, known as "debasement," would create more   money for the king by putting more coins into circulation -- but   it would reduce the coins' value and cause inflation. (In a   "standard" coin, the face value of the coin is worth as much as   the metal in it; in a ''token" coin, the metal is worth less than   the face value. The U.S., and most other modern countries, issue   nothing but token coins. An estimate in the mid-1970s said that   the raw materials in a U.S. quarter were worth only half a cent.)      <LI>Paper money. In a huge leap toward the further abstraction of   money, paper money was introduced in China around 600 AD. Marco   Polo, who visited China in the 1200s, explained, apparently with a   feeling of awe, "All [the Chinese emperor's] subjects receive   [paper money] without hesitation because, wherever their business   may call them, they can dispose of it again in the purchase of   merchandise they may require."      <LI>Goldsmith's receipts. Despite Marco Polo's discovery of paper   money in China, Europeans did not immediately embrace the concept.   Not until the 1600s did they begin to use a simple form of paper   money. During that century, many London merchants would deposit   their gold in the secure storage rooms of the city's goldsmiths   for safekeeping; the goldsmiths would give receipts for the   deposits. As more goldsmiths began to issue these paper receipts,   it became possible to take a receipt to <EM>any </EM>smith and   cash it in, even if this smith wasn't the smith who originally   wrote the receipt. Eventually, people were using the receipts   among themselves, trading them for goods and services. People grew   accustomed to this paper currency, and they began to trust its   value. However, this is not much of an abstraction, because the   receipts could be cashed in for gold, which had a "real" value.      <LI>Fractional reserves. The goldsmiths (like modern-day bankers)   began to lend their depositors' gold. This lending had   implications: At any one time, there would not be enough gold to   cover all of those deposit slips. (A smith might keep only a tiny   percentage of the metal in stock at any moment.) If all of the   depositors had wanted to take out their gold at once, a smith   would have been unable to comply. Thus, the slips were not worth   the gold which they represented; they were worth only as much as   the smith's promise to redeem them -- but that promise could not   be honored if too many withdrawals occurred at once.      <LI>Fiat currency. Eventually paper money became popular, and so   it was printed by governments -- but the money was usually not   "backed" by anything tangible (like the gold in a goldsmith's   vault). In the colonial United States, this "fiat" (unbacked)   currency was printed freely by the federal government -- and it   was also printed <I>legally</I> by states (such as New Jersey with   its 15-shilling notes) and by individuals (such as Ben Franklin).   Because the paper money had no basis in real value, inflation   occurred to the point where the money was worthless. After that   bad experience, the U.S. government stopped printing paper money.   People returned to barter (and to banks' promissory notes); in   fact, the 1810 census showed that the average income of U.S.   citizens was only $2 per person. In the 1860s, the U.S. began to   print money again, to pay for the Civil War; however, by the end   of the war, this fiat currency had inflated such that $300 in   paper money was worth only about $100. Not trusting this currency,   many people hoarded their coins -- and they bartered. By 1880, the   U.S. made a step backward toward a stable economy, by backing its   currency with gold (and allowing people to cash in their currency   for that gold). The monetary system returned to a foundation on   the real substance of gold, rather than on the empty metaphor of a   fiat paper note.      <LI>The end of the gold standard. During World War I, the U.S.   government abandoned its gold standard, in order to pay for the   war with unbacked money. Inflation went wild with all prices   (except for the fixed price of gold). In 1933 the "gold standard"   was officially killed in the U.S.; the government stopped minting   gold coins, and people could no longer own that metal except in   jewelry and coin collections. Production of silver dollars ceased   two years later. Later, during the <I>second</I> World War, many   national governments were supplementing their gold holdings with   U.S. dollars; ironically, at a time when the dollar had lost its   gold backing and was being crippled by the inflation of the   wartime economy, other nations were turning to it for stability.   The story of money's evolution suddenly became more serious, as   those nations based their economies on a dollar which was not   solidly based itself. Eventually the dollars overseas were worth   more than all of the gold in our treasury. Like depositors who are   afraid their bank might fail, some of those nations in the late   1950s began to trade in their dollar reserves for gold. This was a   step backward toward a reliance upon gold instead of the paper   symbol. As huge amounts of gold were traded away from U.S.   reserves, some U.S. economists began to worry about this loss. The   private gold market price rose above the "official" price of $35   per ounce. (<I>Silver</I> was in trouble, too; the silver content   of coins became worth more than the coins themselves, so the U.S.   Treasury stopped minting silver coins in 1965.) As the private   market price of gold continued to elevate, more countries demanded   gold in exchange for the U.S. dollars which they had hoarded.   Finally, in 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon said that the   dollar could no longer be redeemed for gold. Since that time, the   dollar has been "an I.O.U. nothing" (according to former Federal   Reserve Bank vice president John Exter). Or, as writer George   Simpson said, "The whole system is based more or less on   confidence in the stability and economic strength of the U.S.A.   and the Treasury's ability to come up with the cash. If all   together, we decided to convert our savings and checking accounts   into money, the whole system would come tumbling down and everyone   would be broke." However, there is one bright spot: The U.S.   government legalized the private ownership of gold in the   mid-1970s, allowing citizens to possess a time-tested medium of   value and exchange.      <LI>Electronic money. Now, much of our money is so abstract that   its only physical reality is in the form of electrons -- in the   electronic processes of our online banking, credit cards, internet   commerce, automatic teller machines, electronic funds transfers,   etc.</OL><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="line.gif" ALT="line" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=7X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>
