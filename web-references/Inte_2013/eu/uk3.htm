 The UK has an excellent broadband infrastructure, with DSL reaching 99.9% of the
 population and cable reaching more than half of all households. The market is fiercely
 competitive, largely as a result of regulatory measure to provide competitor access
 to British Telecom&#8217;s exchanges. In recent years broadband has been characterised by
 falling prices and a migration to higher speed services: 8Mb/s DSL is available in
 most areas of the country while Virgin Media is moving to a 50Mb/s service and BT has
 plans for a FttC/VDSL service covering 40% of the population. This report profiles the
 overall UK broadband market in 2009, covering broadband technologies and including the
 latest statistics, an update on recent commercial initiatives, an assessment of the
 September 2008 report on Next Generation Access, and forecasts to 2018.</font> <a

 Wireless broadband encompasses a wide variety of technologies and services. FWA,
 WLAN, WiFi and Bluetooth are technologies which facilitate data exchanges without
 wires, cables and other fixed infrastructures. WiFi hotspots provided buy commercial
 players have proliferated in recent years, while a growing number of cities have
 also developed large-scale WiFi/WiMAX zones. This report provides statistics and
 data for the UK&#8217;s wireless broadband market in 2008, reviewing recent developments
 in WiFi and WLAN infrastructure and satellite broadband. It also reviews the status
 of the key market players and spectrum licensing, and looks ahead to opportunities
 for coming years.</font>

 The UK remains at the forefront of media convergence in Europe. The country&#8217;s universal
 DSL and extensive cable networks have been extensively upgraded and provide an excellent
 delivery platform for triple play and emerging quad play services. The digital broadcasting
 industry, including satellite, digital cable, digital terrestrial and IPTV services,
 is well-established. The UK has the highest level of digital TV penetration in Europe,
 with a substantial multichannel environment. This report examines the UK&#8217;s markets

 IPTV and VoIP. It also assesses the UK&#8217;s broadcasting markets, providing statistics

 The UK&#8217;s telecom market is one of the largest in Europe. Mobile and broadband
 penetration are comfortably ahead of the European average, while the country is a leader
 in digital TV take-up. Considerable competitive pressure has reduced consumer prices
 in all sectors, while network capabilities have been greatly expanded following recent
 investments by British Telecom and Virgin Media in Next Generation Networks. This report
 analyses the key aspects of the UK&#8217;s telecom market in 2008, presenting statistics
 on the fixed network services sector and an overview of the key regulatory issues
 including the status of interconnection, Local Loop Unbundling, and carrier preselection.
 The report reviews the major fixed network telecom operators in the UK, examines the
 status of fixed network voice services, and assesses the market impact of BT Openreach.</font> <a href=

 Mobile Data and Forecasts</b></font></a><font face="Arial"><br>
 The UK&#8217;s 3G and mobile data market is one of the largest in Europe. Competition
 among network operators has induced them to provide similar pricing and usage models,
 commonly including between 3GB and 10GB per month. This has substantially increased
 consumer use of mobile data, but high charges for extra usage remains burdensome. Low-key
 data applications such as SMS dominate the market while mobile TV, though widely available,
 has thus far failed to capture public attention. This report surveys the UK&#8217;s mobile
 data market in 2009, providing an overview of 3G developments, regulatory issues and
 technologies. It also profiles the major operators, presents statistics on non-voice
 services, and analyses developments in mobile TV and mobile portals.</font> <a href=

 The UK has one of the largest mobile markets in Europe, both in revenue and in the
 number of subscribers. It is served by five major providers which have all launched
 3G services, as well as by a growing number of low-cost MVNOs. The market is characterised
 by new developments in advanced data services such as mobile TV, the bundling of mobile
 as a quad-play service, and regulatory controls on charges and fees. Mobile penetration
 is above the EU average, yet subscriber growth remains strong as consumers adopt
 additional SIMs as well as business-oriented devices such as the BlackBerry, iPhone
 and G1. Fierce competition has forced operators to concentrate on packaging service
 bundles and line service promotions, and explore applications such as mobile searching
 and advertising facilities. ARPU has been relatively stable for all operators, with
 growing mobile data use offsetting lower voice, interconnection and roaming tariffs.

Office of National Statistics (ONS) indicate that subscriptions
to the Net have grown almost 10%, with more net users switching
to broadband.<br>
<br>
 Subscriptions for dial-up and broadband Internet connections
continued to show opposing patterns of annual growth. The year on
year decrease to April 2004 was 6.8% for dial-up connections with
a decrease of 1.9% from March 2004 to April 2004. There was a
year on year increase of 101.1% for broadband connections with a
monthly increase of 6.1%.<br>
<br>
 Broadband now accounts for 27.2% of Internet connections, up
2.5% on the previous month and up 14.5% on a year ago. Dial-up
subscriptions saw a 6.8% year-on-year decrease.<br>
<br>
 Increased competition between broadband providers has resulted
in a "gold rush" for consumers, with competition giving more
choice and cheaper deals.<br>
<br>
 More people in the UK can now access broadband. BT's latest
stats are that 96% of customers are within range of broadband
access, with a target of 99.6% for the summer of 2005.<br>
