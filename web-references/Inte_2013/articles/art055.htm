cheapest, most effective ways to supercharge your online
marketing</b><br>
<br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">Dear Friend,<br>
<br>
 If you're tired of hearing inflated promises and settling for
lukewarm results with your online marketing &mdash; or if your
results are good, but you'd like to ramp them up to "great" in
record time &mdash; you need to get your hands on this <i>very
different, very profitable</i> new program.<br>
<br>
 Look, I know there's a lot of hype surrounding Internet
marketing. Everyone claims to have the latest "new thing" or
magic bullet. Yet the only online marketing most of these
so-called "experts" have done is the marketing of their "get rich
on the Internet" course or ebook.<br>
<br>
 But this program is truly different.<br>
<br>
 Here's why. To put it bluntly, Bob Serling got fed up with all
the bullshit &mdash; sorry, he rarely curses, but let's not mince
words here. He got tired of all the false promises. He got tired
of the latest whiz-bang technologies that are supposed to get you
massive results, but don't really do squat. And most of all, he
got tired of all the fake, over-inflated claims by every new whiz
kid on the block.<br>
<br>
 I'll bet you are tired too. So he decided to do something about
it. And he is going to let you in on what it really takes to make
serious money with all your online marketing.<br>
<br>
</font> <font face="Verdana"><b>The 3-step formula for ramping up
your online profits</b><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">In addition to the fact
that so much of the advice on Internet marketing simply doesn't
work, there's another reason why so many other books and courses
on this topic stink to high heaven. They're way too complicated.
Some are so technical, you practically need a degree in computer
science to understand them. Others force you to slog through
hundreds of pages just to learn a few techniques that may or may
not work.<br>
<br>
 So Bob decided to create the "dumbest" but most effective
Internet marketing program ever. What he did was turn to those
Internet marketing experts who truly walk their talk and told
them he wanted to create a powerful collection of the most
effective Internet marketing methods &mdash; but using this
unique three-step formula:<br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana" color="#0000CC"><b>1. Each
technique has to be extremely effective<br>
 2. It also has to be cheap, easy, and inexpensive to
implement<br>
 3. You must be able to lay it all out in just a few short
pages<br>
<br>
<br>
</b></font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">And boy, did they ever
come through! You'll get powerful, practical techniques from
these leading experts:</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Everything these 32 experts
share is broken down into short, powerful lessons that are a
breeze to master and implement. Nothing takes more than 15
minutes, tops, to learn and immediately be able to put into
action. For example, here's just a sampling of what you'll
discover:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>*</b></font> <font size="-1"
face="Verdana" color="#000000"><b>Bob Bly's "clockwork"
techniques he uses to sell over $510,000 worth of products and
services every year</b></font><font size="-1" face="Verdana">.
Bob is well known as one of the most successful copywriters in
the world. Just a few years ago, Bob only generated 10% of his
business on the Internet. Now, he generates nearly all of his
business online. You'll discover his simple, clockwork methods
&mdash; techniques that consistently generate new business on a
daily basis, nearly automatically &mdash; that anyone can use to
substantially boost their sales.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana" color="#000000"><b>* How Paul
Hartunian grew his subscriber list from a few thousand to almost
60,000 in short order &mdash; and how he'll easily hit 100,000
subscribers in another month or two</b>. In any business, the key
to increasing profits is to have a dedicated, responsive customer
list. Even though Paul is best known for his brilliant PR system,
you'll be knocked out by his simple, auto-pilot technique he's
using to build a massive customer list in record time. This one
is so easy, anyone can have it up and running in 15 minutes
flat.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* How the most successful
copywriter you never heard of created a hybrid online/offline
marketing strategy that bagged $5 million in online sales in just
five weeks</b>. Ever heard of Clayton Makepeace? Most people
haven't. But Clayton is one of the few "top gun" copywriters the
largest direct marketing firms wait in line for months to hire.
And Clayton gets paid handsomely for it, earning over $1 million
dollars each year for writing a few direct marketing packages.
He's come up with a new hybrid, a way to mix the best online and
offline strategies to rack up massive sales in short order. The
only way you'll hear about it &mdash; and get step-by-step
instructions on how to easily use it in your own business &mdash;
is in my new ebook.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* Would you like to get your
product promoted to over one million people for free</b>? Who
wouldn't! Bob Serling reveals how he regularly gets his products
marketed to over one million people online, racks up substantial
sales, and don't pay a dime to get this massive
exposure.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana" color="#000000"><b>* Joe
Vitale's "squeeze" web site technique for converting 65% more of
your visitors to subscribers or customers</b></font><font size=
"-1" face="Verdana">. Simple, straightforward, and totally
logical, fewer than one out of a hundred web sites take advantage
of this remarkable way to grow your customer list. It just goes
to show that the most effective techniques don't require a degree
in marketing or any special technical expertise to work like
crazy.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* How to turn 10 minutes on
Yahoo Groups into $10,000</b>. Shel Horowitz shares his
incredibly simple &mdash; and absolutely free &mdash; technique
for making money on one of the most accessible mediums on the
Internet. Step-by-step, Shel lays out how anyone can
substantially increase their bottom line profits with this easy,
incredibly effective technique.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* Here's one that absolutely
floored me</b>. Bob Scheinfeld reveals his counter-intuitive
method for selling out his high-priced training programs on the
spot. Bob's method contradicts everything I've ever seen on
Internet marketing, but it works incredibly well. I'm not
surprised, because I've known Bob for years and his marketing
skills have made him a successful "serial entrepreneur" and
multi-millionare. His simple but brilliant strategy will work for
any product or service. I promise you're not going to want to
miss this chapter!</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* Cut your returns to next
to nothing</b>. Tired of hearing that dreaded phrase, "I want my
money back"? Joe Polish and Tim Paulson reveal seven simple,
automatic steps to cut your returns and refund requests to
practically zero. If you currently experience a 3% refund rate
and use this unique approach to cut your refund rate to just 1%,
that alone will pay for this entire program many times
over.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* 23 ways to use Google to
increase your sales and profits</b>. If you think all Google has
to offer is Adwords and Adsense, you're missing out on a ton of
opportunities for improving your business. In this chapter, Derek
Gehl, President of the Internet Marketing Center (the company
Corey Rudl founded) shows you a wealth of innovative ways to
harness the full power of Google for increasing your sales and
profits. While your competition is settling for just two ways of
profiting from Google, you'll have an arsenal of tools for
squeezing every last penny of profit out of Google and leaving
those competitors in your dust.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* Discover how a company
built a powerful email list of 250,000 highly responsive
customers in under two years</b>. Paul Myer's "Track Your
Talkers" technique is unique, incredibly easy to use, and
revealed here for the first time. Now you too can easily plug it
in and use this technique to build a massive email list in no
time flat.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* 7 mistakes to avoid with
your online marketing</b>. While the majority of this program
focuses on things to do to improve your business, in this
important chapter, Randy Gage shows you 7 mistakes to avoid at
all costs. As important as it is to be doing the right things
with your marketing, you can flush your efforts down the drain by
committing any of these 7 deadly mistakes. Find out what they
are, along with simple solutions for avoiding each and every
one.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* How to create a search
engine traffic bonanza in a matter of days</b>. For the second

best small business blog of all. You'll see why when John reveals
a remarkably simple and reliable way of using a simple blog to
drive thousands of new visitors to your web site. It doesn't get
any easier than this!</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* The two-word test that
resulted in a sales increase of 112%</b>. As I've repeatedly
promised throughout this letter, producing exceptional results
with your online marketing doesn't have to be time consuming or
expensive.</font> <font size="-1" face="Verdana">Audri and Jim
Lanford reveal the power of smart testing to increase your
results &mdash; more subscribers, more customers, and more sales
&mdash; in short order. They'll show you how testing a change of
just two words in a single paragraph produced a phenomenal boost
in sales of 112%. This technique is so simple, and the real-life
examples are so clear, you can have it up and bringing in more
sales in a matter of minutes.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>* The inside secrets to
profiting with Google Adwords</b>. Pay-per-click advertising is a
complicated beast. There are dozens of rules and Google changes
them on the fly, making mastering this lucrative medium time
consuming and difficult. BUT &mdash; there are only three
critical factors you have to master to really make your Adwords
campaigns pay off. Perry Marshall, the leading expert on all
things Google, shows you exactly what these three components are,
allowing you to significantly reduce the time and expense it
takes to make Google pay major dividends.</font></p>

<br>
 Again, this is just a partial sample of what you'll find
in</font> <a href=
"http://www.cloverhosting.com/onlineprofits.htm" target=
"_blank"><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b><i>Online Profits at
the Speed of Light</i></b></font></a><font size="-1" face=
"Verdana">. There's so much valuable information jammed into this
program, that I don't have room to cover it all here. But I'll
tell you this &mdash; in editing the manuscript, Bob personally
discovered so many new ideas &mdash; powerful, practical,
money-in-the-bank ideas &mdash; his "to do" list is getting out
of control.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Here's how to start making all
your online marketing much less work and much more
profitable.<br>
<br>
 I want to emphasize that every strategy and technique you'll
discover in this program has to meet Bob's three-step formula to
be included. He told his roster of experts that he wanted only
practical, powerful techniques that met these three
requirements:<br>
<br>
 <b>1. Each technique has to be extremely effective<br>
 2. It also has to be cheap, easy, and inexpensive to
implement<br>
 3. You must be able to lay it all out in just a few short
pages</b><br>
<br>
 His goal was to pack this program with highly profitable online
marketing strategies and techniques, but at the same time, he
wanted to make your life easier, not add a lot of complex tasks
that waste hours of your time and practically make marketing a
second career.<br>
<br>
 So you can be certain that every powerful technique you'll find
in this program takes just 10 to 15 minutes to read about, and as
little time and money as possible to put into action.<br>
