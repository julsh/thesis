Results<br>
</b></font> 
<p><a href="http://www.grokker.com/" target="_blank"><font face=
"Arial">Grokker</font></a> <font face="Arial">is a new way to
look at search. It shows Web search results on a circular map
rather than in a list. Grokker displays a Web search as a series
of categories set in a circular map, it runs as a Java plug-in
for browsers. The program will rely on online search revenue from
advertisements placed by the Yahoo ad placement service, a.k.a.
Overture. The idea behind Grokker is that by showing categories
instead of a ranking listing, web searchers may uncover gold they
would have otherwise missed. However, this fancy visualization
system is somewhat confusing at first. Even for expert users this
situation don't enhance search productivity. Groxis (pronounced
GRAHK-sis) is named for a term in "Stranger in a Strange Land,"
by the science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein. To grok
something is to understand it completely.<br>
<br>
 Another search company, Vivisimo, has introduced a
consumer-oriented search engine called Clusty,</font> <a href=
"http://www.clusty.com/" target="_blank"><font face=
"Arial">www.clusty.com</font></a><font face="Arial">, which tries
to deal with the problem of hidden information by displaying a
list of folders to the left of the search results, adding an
alternative category view in addition to a simple ranked
listing.<br>
<br>
 Try the new format for</font> <a href="http://www.grokker.com/"
target="_blank"><font face="Arial">round search
results</font></a> <font face="Arial">and then try the</font> <a
href="http://www.clusty.com/" target="_blank"><font face=
"Arial">vivisimo cluster search</font></a><font face="Arial">.
Next compare the speed and quality of the results for these two
alternate web search tools. You be the judge.<br>

Press?</b></font><br>
<p><font face="Arial">The latest numbers on newspaper circulation
tell the story: most of the biggest dailies in the United States
dropped, and none scored big gains. According to the</font> <a
href="http://www.readerprofile.com/" target="_blank"><font face=
"Arial">Audit Bureau of Circulations</font></a> <font face=
"Arial">(ABC), daily US newspaper circulation took its biggest
fall in nearly a decade, dropping 1.9% in the six-month period
ending March 31. That was the largest decline since 1995-1996,
when circulation fell nearly 2.1%. Sunday circulation declined
2.5% over the last six months, compared with the same period a
year ago.<br>
<br>
 The rate of decline has been 0.5% to 1% since newspaper
circulation peaked in the mid-1980s, but this year's drop alarms
many in the business. In a Carnegie Corporation report, 44% of
the 18-to-34-year-olds surveyed said they frequent Internet
portals such as Google and Yahoo News once a day or more, to stay
up-to-date on the news. Most see the Internet news as being as
trustworthy as newspapers. Only 19% of them rank newspapers as
their primary source for current information.<br>
<br>
 "The future course of the news, including the basic assumptions
about how we consume news and information and make decisions in a
democratic society, is being altered by technology-savvy young
people no longer wedded to traditional news outlets or even
accessing news in traditional ways," wrote Merrill Brown, a media
consultant and founding editor-in-chief of</font> <a href=
"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/" target="_blank"><font face=
"Arial">MSNBC</font></a><font face="Arial">, in the report.<br>
<br>
 Youth-drain is not the whole explanation for the decline.
Readers simply have access to a great many news outlets that
didn't exist 20 years ago &mdash; including the online sites of
the newspapers themselves. In reaction to falling revenues, many
newspapers have trimmed staff and coverage &mdash; eroding both
the quality and quantity of their basic print product. Is this a
death spiral?<br>
<br>
 Rupert Murdoch, chairman of</font> <a href=
"http://www.newscorp.com/operations/newspapers.html" target=
"_blank"><font face="Arial">News Corp</font></a><font face=
"Arial">, owner of 175 newspapers around the world, in a recent
speech warned that newspapers risk being "relegated to the status
of also-rans." He also pointed toward a way forward. "Today, the
newspaper is just a paper, Tomorrow, it can be a destination." In
other words, the newspapers will become like the Internet
portals, and the Yahoos, Googles and the MSNs will become like
newspapers.<br>
