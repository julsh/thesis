<p><font face="Arial">Dear Reader</font>,<br>
<font face="Arial">We are almost there, very soon the Internet will hit two billion
 users. Yes, almost <b>2,000,000,000</b> with a big <b>B</b>, two billion people are
 using the Internet. An amazing accomplishment because in just 15 years (1995-2010),
 the Knowledge Society has conquered Planet Earth, and nothing will be the same
 ever again. “One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind”, like
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong" target="_blank">
 someone</a> said before me, 41 years ago.<br>
<br>
 But today I am not going to discuss the Internet. Today, for the first time,
 we show our methodology applied to analyzing the <b>Facebook World Stats</b>.
 The results are very revealing regarding the power and worldwide force of this
 web platform that has grown to become by far the largest and most important
 social network in the Internet.<br>
<br> 
 The results are summarized in a new statistics table and three bar charts, that
 you can view at <a href="../stats25.htm" target="_blank">
 Facebook World Usage</a>, using data as of August 31, 2010. We have found
 useful to introduce a new Internet Metric that we shall call the <b>Facebook Index</b>.
 It corresponds to the percentage of Internet Users that are also Facebook Users,
 in any country or geographic region. This is all explained below.<br>
<br>
 So, without further delay, please enjoy this special IWS Newsletter issue.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Tables are a little hard to read if you are not trained in
 handling this type of information. For this reason, we also produce the graphics
 which are easy to understand and analize. Anyway, the first column gives the eight
 geographic regions we divided the world into. They are ordered by population size.
 Asia is in the first spot because it has the largest population. Next is Africa
 and so forth. Last is the Oceania region with the smallest population. This last
 region includes Australia, New Zealand and all the South Pacific islands.<br>
<br>
 Next column features the Facebook Users for each region. Europe has the largest
 number of users, 162 million, and next is North America with 149 million Facebook
 users. The fourth column features the Facebook penetration by world regions, the
 next column represents the Facebook Index. The last two columns are simply the
 number of Internet users and their penetration in each world region.</font><br>

color="#666699"><b>The Facebook Index Chart</b>
</font><br>
<p><font face="Arial">This bar chart is the green one and quite original. It shows
 that in North America and Oceania <b>over 50% of Internet users are also Facebook
 users</b>. In the next 3 regions (the Caribbean, Latin America and Europe) we
 find that Facebook is also very popular and 34.1% to 39.0% Internet Users also
 use the Facebook. In the last 3 regions Facebook is less popular. The conclusion
 is that the world average is 26.3%, this means that about one out of every four
 Internet users are also Facebook users, 517 million worldwide.<br>

<p><font face="Arial">The second chart, the blue one, shows the impressive growth
 of Facebook users in Europe, 162 million. See for yourselves the other regions.
 This information is useful for estimating potential market size in each world
 region when you use Facebook for advertizing purposes, very impressive.</font></p>

color="#666699"><b>Facebook Penetration Chart</b></font><br>
<p><font face="Arial">This bar chart, the red one, shows how much Facebook has
 penetrated each world region. In North America, for example, 43.3% of the population
 uses Facebook. In Australia and Oceania, a third (33.4%) of the total population
 uses Facebook.The most impressive data, is that 7.6% of the total world population
 uses Facebook.</font><br>
<br>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">One last thing before closing: Do not compare
 Facebook and Google. This is like comparing apples and oranges. They are
 two completely different things. A lot of articles in the Media try to
 gain readership with foolish ideas and faulty analysis. Crazy headlines with
 no content underneath.<br>
