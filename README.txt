Running the app:

Unfortunately, since Apple is very restrictive with their code signing policy, there is no point in delivering an executable here, since it would be of no use. There are two ways to actually run the app yourself:

Option 1:
Get a Testflight account, send an email to julia_hro@gmx.de with the UUID of the device you want to test on and I'll unlock you as a beta tester

Option 2:
Install Xcode, it comes with the iPhone simulator. You should be able to just open the .xcodeproj file with Xcode and build & run in debug mode.

Documentation:

- open the index.html file for plain listing of all classes
- open the hierarchy.html file for classes grouped by superclass
